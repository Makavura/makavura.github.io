                            With a growing product backlog and an increased developer velocity, it was necessary to
                            capture bugs before release and
                            ensure complete functionality of new features - to save time and guarantee a smooth user
                            experience. I contributed to
                            e2e testing efforts both locally and on staging.

                            With the product development team growing suddenly beyond just the CTO and I, the
                            development process that worked well
                            for two had to be improved. Collaboratively and through several sprint iterations I
                            contributed to reducing sprint
                            length, unit task breakdown, a culture of extreme ownership and subsequently reduced team
                            member task dependent
                            blockers, had faster review/release cycles and reduced errors and complexity in new features
                            by focusing on quality on
                            unit tasks.

                            A new roadmap that introduced new features that implemented customer feedback and would
                            introduce breaking changes meant
                            going back to the drawing board. With complexity, maintainability, cloud vendor costs and a
                            fluid user experience in
                            mind. The CTO and I collaboratively redesigned the architecture to leverage event driven
                            workflows, new technologies and
                            upgraded ones. This enabled us to adopt a phased approach and successfully migrate to a
                            version 2 of the product. This
                            included creating migration and backup scripts for phased deployment as well.

                            A product with multiple facets, a growing monorepo and with the concerns of composability,
                            maintainability and
                            reusability necessitated the promotion of code into monorepo wide installable utils. This
                            included MUI React styled
                            components that followed the product design guidelines, database utility functions and
                            endpoint security wrappers
                            leveraging Sentry.

                            In several scenarios, I took initiative to fill in the gaps to fast track a feature e.g when
                            a designer was not
                            available and a refactor required a major haul of the user interface. With reference to the
                            existing design guidelines,
                            domain knowledge and functional requirements create user interfaces that met business goals
                            and that exceeded
                            expectations.

                            As one of the the front-end engineer of a newly created product team, there were
                            requirements provided yet no consensus
                            on the
                            mobile and user interfaces. Leveraging my Figma expertise, I created the wireframes and high
                            fidelity mockups which
                            unified development efforts after approval by the product owner. Additionally, it reduced
                            time to feature for change
                            requests that were out of the initial scope.

                            As a development research assistant in my primary team, I was tasked with finding solutions
                            to the unique technological
                            challenges of that our product development exposed. This included finding compatible open
                            source technologies. However,
                            the product being of a unique nature meant refactoring and creating custom libraries,
                            scripts and components that were
                            innovative due to resource constraints. This resulted in improved developer velocity and
                            feature quality since the
                            development team could leverage them and focus on feature delivery without a doubt on the
                            how.

                            As part of DevOps, a roll-out of the product on clients' custom environments meant possibly
                            encountering variations and
                            situations where there might be conflicts with existing applications already deployed. This
                            necessitated automation
                            leveraging bash scripts to eliminate repetitive and conditional tasks that would otherwise
                            consume a lot of time.
                            Packaging the product into containers bundled with all requirements ensuring a smooth and
                            brief deployment. Tagging
                            releases and having a central registry that enabled on premise deployment from the cloud
                            registry.

                            During a product release with multiple high level differences in user roles, it was
                            necessary to have an effective
                            manual bundled with the product. I was part of the documentation process which beyond
                            providing users with an intuitive,
                            concise guidance it significantly aided QA efforts due to the complexity of the product.

                            As part of an ongoing in-house SAAS (Software as a Service) product development culture. I
                            was tasked with developing a
                            Records Management System that included features like: inventory management, record
                            tracking, record request, user and
                            role management as well as role based access. With a skeletal architecture from business
                            requirements, I developed the
                            full stack web and mobile MVP. I leveraged Angular, Core-UI in the front-end,
                            NodeJs/Typescript, MongoDB Atlas Cloud for
                            the back-end, Azure Cloud for container provisioning and network management and Flutter for
                            the mobile application.
                            Developed the MVP from git init to deployment in several weeks with minimal supervision.
                            Post-MVP suggestions I made
                            included included having a company wide product/feature release announcement channel to
                            encourage beta testing and
                            promote intrapreneurship.

                            In an effort to attract and improve developer capacity, I was tasked with conducting
                            developer interviews. Beyond that I
                            took initiative to suggest an in house leveling up program for new interns and to onboard
                            them to our tech stack. Focus
                            areas included training on git, collaborative git workflows, REST API, Cloud environment
                            management and deployment on
                            Azure. Additionally, as an Open edX expert I mentored and facilitated the training of an
                            intern in the domain who could
                            ensure ongoing support, customization and deployment of existing and new client requests.

                            A new Open edX client requested training on customization, deployment and maintenance of
                            Open edX instances on Azure. I
                            prepared and presented tutorials, created developer centered documentation and conducted
                            training session to completion.

                            Participated in Microsoft Developer Certification as part of Microsoft's Partnership to
                            contribute to the organizational
                            goal of Gold Certification.

                            Contributed as a research assistant in a phased consultation whose initial step was a
                            feasibility study for migration to
                            Drupal. Included technical assessment of existing platforms, interviews with third party
                            partners of the platform as
                            well as offering expert opinion on alternatives, improvements and opportunities for growth.
                            Included preparing a brief
                            Drupal demo.
